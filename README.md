I originally used this when studying for the GRE (see my GRE_Study_Tools repo). But it still comes in handy. It simply counts down the minutes you passed via parameters. Then a number of minutes and seconds are displayed every second the time has passed passed number of minutes.

Usage: timer \<number of minutes\>
